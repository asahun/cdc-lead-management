Subject: Possible state-held funds related to [Company Legal Name]

Hi [FirstName],

I specialize in finding state-held unclaimed funds and loose ends tied to dissolved or inactive entities. In reviewing [State]'s records, it appears [Company Legal Name] may have items still sitting with the state under its name.

If this is something you'd want to tidy up, I can send a short summary of what I'm seeing and the steps a former owner/officer can take to recover anything that belongs to the company or its stakeholders, including filing directly with the state if you prefer.

If you're no longer the right contact, I'm happy to reach out to whoever handled the wind-down or finances instead.

Best,
