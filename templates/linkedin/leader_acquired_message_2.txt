Hi [FirstName], just following up in case my last note got buried.

In short, I'm looking at potential state-held funds tied to [Company Legal Name] and [New Entity Name] in [State], where the current company is the rightful successor after the merger / acquisition / rename. I can map out a simple path to recover anything that's there.

If this isn't on your plate, is there someone in treasury, finance, or accounting at [New Entity Name] you'd recommend I contact instead?
