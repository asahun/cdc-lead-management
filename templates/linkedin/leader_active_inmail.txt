Subject: Quick question about potential state-held funds for [Company Legal Name]

Hi [FirstName],

I work with companies to identify state-held unclaimed funds (old credits, refunds, dormant accounts) that appear under their name in state databases and often go unnoticed.

A preliminary check suggests there may be items reported under [Company Legal Name] in [State]'s unclaimed property records. You can always claim directly with the state, or I can help organize and track the recovery if you prefer support.

If this is worth a look, I can send a short summary of what I'm seeing and what the recovery steps would be so you can decide if it's worth pursuing. If someone else on your team (finance / accounting) is a better contact, I'm happy to reach out to them instead.

Best,
