Hi [FirstName], just following up in case my last note slipped through.

In short, I may have found potential unclaimed funds tied to [Company Legal Name] despite its dissolved status, and I can outline the steps to recover them if it's worth your time.

If you're not the right person for this anymore, is there someone else who handled the wind-down / accounting for the company that I should contact instead?
