Hi [FirstName], just following up in case my last note got buried.

In short, I may be able to flag potential unclaimed funds or cleanup items tied to [Company Legal Name] and outline steps the company can take directly with the state.

If this isn't something you typically handle, is there a best contact at [Company Legal Name] (finance/accounting or legal) that you'd suggest I reach out to?
