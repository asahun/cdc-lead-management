Hi [FirstName], just following up in case my last message slipped through.

In short, I may have found potential unclaimed funds or cleanup items tied to [Company Legal Name] despite its dissolved status, and I can outline the steps for whoever handled the wind-down / ownership to recover anything that's theirs.

If you're not the right person for this, is there someone else (at the firm or connected to the former owners) you'd recommend I contact?
