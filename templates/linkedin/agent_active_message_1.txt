Hi [FirstName], thanks for connecting.

I help businesses identify state-held unclaimed funds and SOS issues tied to their entities. In some cases, the only reliable contact on record is the registered agent or firm that supports them.

For [Company Legal Name], I can put together a short summary of what I'm seeing in [State] and what the company would need to do to recover anything that belongs to them.

Would you prefer I share that here so you can pass it along, or by email?
