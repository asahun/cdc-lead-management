Hi [FirstName], thanks for connecting.

I review state unclaimed-property and SOS data, including items that still sit under prior names or acquired entities, not just the current company name.

For [Company Legal Name] / [New Entity Name] in [State], it looks like there may be items worth checking that would belong to the current organization as successor. If you'd like, I can share a short summary of what I'm seeing and the steps to recover anything that's actually yours — including filing directly with the state if you prefer.

Would you rather see that in a quick email, or here on LinkedIn?
