Hi [FirstName], thanks for connecting.

I spend my time reviewing state unclaimed-property and SOS data to spot funds that are sitting with the state under a company's name and haven't been claimed yet.

If you'd like, I can do a quick check for [Company Legal Name] in [State] and share what I see, plus the steps to recover anything that's actually yours — whether you file directly with the state or want help.

Would a short overview by email be better, or is LinkedIn fine?
