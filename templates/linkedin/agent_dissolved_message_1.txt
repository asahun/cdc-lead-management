Hi [FirstName], thanks for connecting.

I review state unclaimed-property and SOS data and often see dissolved or inactive entities that still have funds or loose ends sitting with the state. In those cases, the registered agent or filing firm is sometimes the only practical contact.

For [Company Legal Name], I can put together a short note on what I'm seeing in [State] and what options exist for the former owners/officers to recover any funds or clean up records.

Would it be helpful if I send that here so you can pass it along, or by email?
