Subject: Possible state-held funds tied to [New Entity Name] & legacy entities

Hi [FirstName],

I work with companies to locate state-held unclaimed funds not only under their current name, but also under prior names and acquired entities that sometimes remain in state records after mergers or name changes.

In reviewing [State]'s data, it appears that [Company Legal Name] / [New Entity Name] may have items still sitting with the state under a legacy record. As the successor, [New Entity Name] would generally be in position to recover those funds.

If this is worth a quick look, I can send a short summary of what I'm seeing and outline the recovery steps so you can decide if it's worth pursuing. If someone else in treasury/finance is a better contact, I'm happy to reach out to them instead.

Best,
