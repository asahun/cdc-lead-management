Hi [FirstName], thanks for connecting.

I review state unclaimed-property and SOS data and sometimes find dissolved or inactive entities that still have funds or loose ends sitting with the state.

For [Company Legal Name], it looks like there may be items worth checking in [State]. If you'd like, I can share a short summary of what I'm seeing and what options exist to recover anything that belongs to the company or its former owners.

Would you prefer I send that here, or by email?
