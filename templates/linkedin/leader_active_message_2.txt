Hi [FirstName], just following up in case my last note got buried.

In short, I look at state records to flag potential unclaimed funds tied to [Company Legal Name] and lay out a simple path to recover them. A lot of teams just haven't had time to dig into this.

If this isn't on your plate, is there someone in finance or accounting at [Company Legal Name] you'd recommend I contact instead?
