<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
Following up one final time regarding the unclaimed property item reported under the dissolved or inactive business
<strong>[OldBusinessName]</strong> (GA – Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>). The item is still showing as unclaimed in
Georgia’s public records.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
If you’d like, I can resend the summary or share the state’s verification link so you can take a quick look.  
If someone else handled matters for the business, I’m glad to forward the information to them instead.
</p>

Thank you for your time, and please feel free to reply if you'd like the details resent.
