<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
Just reaching out one last time regarding the unclaimed property item listed under your name 
(Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>). It is still showing as unclaimed in Georgia’s public records.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
If you’d like, I can resend the summary or provide the state’s verification link so you can take a quick look.  
If someone else handles matters like this for you, I’m glad to forward the details to them instead.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">
Thank you, and please feel free to reply if you'd like the information resent.
</p>
