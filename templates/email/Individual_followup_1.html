<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
I wanted to follow up on my earlier message regarding the unclaimed property item reported under your name 
(Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>) in the State of Georgia’s unclaimed property records.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
No action is required — I just want to make sure the information reached you. If helpful, I can resend the summary or 
provide the direct link to the state’s public search page so you can verify the item independently.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">
If this does not apply to you, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I’m glad to guide you through the next steps or point 
you to the self-service option.
</p>
