    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
      We identified an unclaimed property item reported under the dissolved or inactive business name
      <strong>[OldBusinessName]</strong>. The funds are currently held by the State of Georgia
      (Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>). This is not a notice from the state; it is an alert that the item remains
      unclaimed until an eligible party files the claim. I work with business owners and former principals on
      unclaimed property recovery and compliance, with a focus on Georgia.
