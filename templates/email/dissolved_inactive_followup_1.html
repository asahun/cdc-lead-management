<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
I’m following up on my earlier message regarding the unclaimed property item reported under the dissolved or inactive
business name <strong>[OldBusinessName]</strong> (GA – Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>).
No action is required — I just want to make sure this reached you, especially since older business records can be hard to route.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
If it helps, I can resend the summary or provide the direct link to Georgia’s public unclaimed-property portal so you can
quickly verify the listing.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">
If you were an owner, member, or officer of the former business and prefer that I forward this to another email, just let me know.
</p>
