    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
      We identified an unclaimed property item associated with
      <strong>[Company Legal Name]</strong> that is currently held by the State of Georgia
      (Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>). This is not a notice from the state; it is an alert that funds remain
      unclaimed until a representative of your organization files the claim. I work with organizations on
      unclaimed property recovery and compliance, with a focus on Georgia.
    </p>

      If your team oversees unclaimed property, AP, or treasury records, you may wish to review this item. You have two options:
    </p>
  
    <ul style="margin: 0 0 12px 22px; padding: 0;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">
        <strong>Handle internally</strong> — we can point your team to the official State of Georgia unclaimed property portal
        if you prefer to manage the filing in-house.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">
        <strong>Use our full-service option</strong> — success-based claim preparation, submission, and follow-through,
        including coordination of the documentation the state requires.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
      Please let me know whether you’d prefer the state portal link for internal handling or a brief conversation about our
      full-service support, and I will follow up accordingly.
    </p>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 8px 0;">
      If you are not the appropriate contact for unclaimed property matters, please forward this to the relevant AP, treasury,
      or compliance contact or let me know who the right person would be.
    </p>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 11px; color: #666;">
      You can independently verify this record at any time through Georgia’s public unclaimed property portal.
