<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
Following up one last time — the unclaimed property item reported under 
<strong>[Old Entity Legal Name]</strong> (GA – Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>) is still showing as unclaimed.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
I’m glad to resend the summary or the official state lookup link if that would be helpful.  
If someone else on your team oversees legacy or predecessor entity records, I’d appreciate the correct contact.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">
Thank you for your time.
