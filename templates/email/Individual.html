    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
      We identified an unclaimed property item reported under your name in the State of Georgia’s unclaimed property
      records (Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>). This is not a notice from the state; it is an alert that the funds remain
      unclaimed until an eligible claimant files a claim with the state. I work with individuals on unclaimed property
      recovery and compliance, with a focus on Georgia.
    </p>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 6px 0;">

      If you believe this may relate to you, you have two options:
    </p>
  
    <ul style="margin: 0 0 12px 22px; padding: 0;">
      <li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">
        <strong>File directly with the state</strong> — I can point you to the official State of Georgia unclaimed property
        portal and provide a brief overview of the steps to submit a claim on your own.
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 6px;">
        <strong>Use our full-service option</strong> — success-based support with guidance on documentation, preparation of
        forms, and follow-through until the state completes its review.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
      Please let me know whether you’d prefer to handle this directly with the state using the portal link or to discuss
      our full-service support, and I will follow up accordingly.
    </p>
  
    <p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0; font-size: 11px; color: #666;">
      You can independently verify this record at any time through Georgia’s public unclaimed property portal.
