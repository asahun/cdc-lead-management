<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
I wanted to follow up on my earlier note regarding the unclaimed property item associated with 
<strong>[Company Legal Name]</strong> (GA – Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>).  
No action is required — I only want to ensure this reached the appropriate person for review.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
If helpful, I can resend the summary or provide the official Georgia lookup link so the item can be verified directly.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">
Thank you, and please let me know if this should go to someone else on your team.
</p>
