<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">Hi [FirstName],</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
I’m following up on my earlier note regarding the unclaimed property item reported under the former entity 
<strong>[Old Entity Legal Name]</strong> (GA – Ref: <strong>[ID]</strong>).  
No action is required — I just want to make sure this reached the appropriate team for legacy entity matters.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 12px 0;">
If helpful, I can resend the summary or provide the State of Georgia’s verification link so it can be reviewed directly.
</p>

<p style="margin: 0;">
Please let me know if this should be routed to your legal, AP compliance, or post-acquisition accounting contact.
</p>
